<span style="text-align:center; color:red;font-size:2em;font-weight:3em"> Bouncy Pumpkin Halloween 2019<span>

Decided to take a break and work on something fun. 
This is what I came up with.   

Learned alot about animation, I think I have a love hate relationship with it.   

For those that say you don't need to be good at math, have never tried to figure out how many degrees you need to rotate something to make it look good.   

This was still a fun project, and it is one of three projects.  

The final project being [Happy Falloween](https://happy-falloween.netlify.com/)
